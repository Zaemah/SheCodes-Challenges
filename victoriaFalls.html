              <h2>Why Victoria Falls?</h2>
              <h3>Mosi oa-Tunya, "the smoke that thunders"</h3>
              <p>
                Victoria Falls is is undoubtedly one of the most spectacular natural wonders in the world. Spanning over a mile wide and dropping more than 350 feet, it is considered the largest waterfall on Earth. However, its significance goes far beyond its impressive size.
              It  holds immense cultural and historical importance to the local indigenous people. Known as "Mosi-oa-Tunya" or "The Smoke that Thunders," it has been a sacred site for centuries. The falls are believed to be inhabited by powerful spirits, and rituals and ceremonies are still performed there today.
              Victoria Falls is not only visually stunning but also offers a range of thrilling activities for visitors. From bungee jumping off the famous Victoria Falls Bridge to white-water rafting in the Zambezi River below, adrenaline junkies flock here from all corners of the globe.
            </p>
              <p>
                 Victoria Falls is surrounded by an abundance of wildlife and lush vegetation. The spray from the falls creates a unique microclimate that supports a diverse ecosystem. Visitors can take part in safaris or simply enjoy walking through rainforests teeming with exotic birds and animals.
                Victoria Falls serves as a symbol of unity between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Despite being divided by borders, both countries share this natural wonder as a common heritage that brings them together.
                Victoria Falls stands out not just for its sheer size but also for its cultural significance, thrilling activities, rich biodiversity, and unifying power. It truly deserves its place among the world's most extraordinary natural wonders.

                  <h1>1. It is the largest waterfall in the world</h1>
                <p>Victoria Falls is neither the widest nor highest waterfall in the world, but it’s the world’s largest sheet of falling water, 
                    which solidifies this classification. 
                    It is twice the height of North America’s Niagara Falls, and is only rivalled by Iguazu Falls in South America. It is 108m tall and 1708m wide.</p>

                   <p> The Zambezi River is the fourth-largest in the African continent and spans across six different nations – its amazing journey spans an impressive
                     2,700 km. Along the way, you can see a range of wildlife and participate in a plethora of activities.

                        Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is home to part of Victoria Falls and is named so because “Mosi-Oa-Tunya” means
                         “the smoke that thunders” – a perfect analogy for these awe-inspiring waters. 
                        Victoria Falls is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, found in Victoria Falls National Park.

                            In 1855, British explorer and missionary David Livingstone was the first European to witness 
                            the magnificence of one of Africa’s most incredible sights, Victoria Falls. He named it for the British monarch at the time, Queen Victoria. 
                            While many places have reverted to their indigenous names, the local people had so much respect for him that it has remained unchanged.

                            negative media attention in recent years, locals assure visitors that it is incredibly safe, and typically makes for a more superior viewing experience.</p>

                                           <p> A rainbow is beautiful; a moonbow is a special and unique phenomenon which only occurs in two places around the world, 
                                             with Victoria Falls being one of them.
                                              A lunar rainbow happens when the light of the full moon hits the Falls, and it is a sight to behold.</p>

                                                You will be entering into the natural habitat of an abundance of animals, including many of the continent’s elusive “Big Five”. 
                                                Be wary – crocodiles are particularly common in the region, so take extra care.
                                                 Remember, part of respecting nature is appreciating that you could be in danger. Always listen to your local guides’ advice.</p>

                                             This is not something that should be attempted without proper consideration, as it involves a swim in the Zambezi and a reliance on the water to carry you. Once you reach the edge, however, the feeling is exhilarating. 
                                            Consider it as the best infinity pool in the world! You can only do this when water levels are lowest, from September to December.</p>

              <h3>History of Victoria Falls</h3>
              <p>
                Archaeology and oral history describe a long record of African knowledge of the site. 
                Though known to some European geographers before the 19th century, Scottish missionary David Livingstone identified the falls in 1855, 
                naming them Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria. In 1901 people started settling in the town of Victoria Falls. 
                The town got its start as an area of interest for hydro-electric power and a gateway to the wealth of the north
                 but is now mainly a tourist hub, as a base for people to explore the falls and the national park.
                 Since the mid-20th century, the site has been a source of tourism. 
                Zambia and Zimbabwe both have national parks and tourism infrastructure at the site. 
                Research in the late 2010s found that precipitation variability due to climate change is likely to change the character of the falls.

              <h3>The Victoria Falls Bridge</h3>
              <p>
                In 1905 construction of the Victoria Falls Bridge was completed, which greatly opened up tourism to the area.
                 The bridge was commissioned by Cecil John Rhodes, as part of his “Cape to Cairo” vision, with the specific instructions 
                 that it was in a location where passing trains would be sprayed by the mist to add a thrilling experience to the passenger’s journey.
                  Unfortunately, he passed away before it was completed, and with it his dreams of exploiting the region’s resources for himself. 
                  The bridge and railway provided access to travellers from as far north as the Belgian Congo and as far as south as Cape Town. 
                  Now, the bridge is a popular spot for adrenaline junkies who like to bungee jump or bridge swing from its great height. 
                  For history and/or engineering fans, it is also possible to take a tour of the bridge with a guide who is dressed like 
                an engineer from the early 1900s while you are strapped in with a safety harness, walking along the lower catwalk to explore the structural intricacies.
